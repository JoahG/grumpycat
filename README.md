    - `!admin setKarma @username [karmaAmount]` - sets karma value on user
  - The initial (and permanent) Admin users should be set in a comma-delimited list in the `ADMIN_USERS` environment variable.
  - You can also optionally set permanently banned users in a comma-delimited list in the `BANNED_USERS` environment variable.
  - Code: [`/src/events/admin.js`](https://github.com/JoahG/grumpycat/blob/master/src/events/admin.js)
